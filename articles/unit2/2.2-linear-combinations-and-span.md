# Linear Combinations and Span

_What can you build with a set of vectors?_

---

## The Column Picture

Remember back in Unit 1, we solved systems like:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 3y &= 8 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

We called this the **row picture**: each equation is a line, and we find where they intersect.

But there's another way to look at the same system. Let's rewrite it:

$$
x \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Now the question becomes: can we find scalars $x$ and $y$ such that this **linear combination** of column vectors equals the target vector?

This is the **column picture**.

## Linear Combinations

A **linear combination** of vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k$ is any expression of the form:

$$
c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k
$$

where $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ are scalars (real numbers).

You take each vector, scale it by some amount, and add them all together.

### Example

Let: 

$$\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Some linear combinations:

$$3\mathbf{v}_1 + 2\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$-\mathbf{v}_1 + 4\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$0\mathbf{v}_1 + 0\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

In fact, with these two vectors, we can reach *any* point in ℝ². To get to $\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$, just use $a\mathbf{v}_1 + b\mathbf{v}_2$.

**Practice Problem:** What is the following?

$$2\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + (-1)\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\text{(A) } \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{(B) } \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{(C) } \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{(D) } \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$$

**(A) $\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$**

$$
2\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + (-1)\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}
$$

</details>

## Span: All Possible Linear Combinations

Given a set of vectors, the **span** is the set of *all* vectors you can create as linear combinations.

$$
\text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\} = \{c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k : c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

Think of it as: "What can I reach by scaling and adding these vectors?"

### Span of One Vector

Consider a single vector:

$$\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Its span is all scalar multiples: $c\mathbf{v}$ for any $c$.

Geometrically, this is a **line through the origin** in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$.

**[PLACEHOLDER: Static image]**

\text{Span}\bigl\{\mathbf{v}\bigr\} = \text{a line through the origin}
$$

### Span of Two Vectors in ℝ²

Now take two vectors:

$$\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

These point in *different* directions (neither is a scalar multiple of the other).

Their span is **all of ℝ²** — every point in the plane can be reached!

### When Two Vectors Don't Span ℝ²

What if $\mathbf{v}_2$ is just a scaled version of $\mathbf{v}_1$?

Let:

$$\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$

Notice that $\mathbf{v}_2 = 2\mathbf{v}_1$. Any linear combination is:

$$
c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 (2\mathbf{v}_1) = (c_1 + 2c_2)\mathbf{v}_1
$$

This is still just a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{v}_1$ — we never leave the line!

$$
\text{Span}\bigl\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2\bigr\} = \text{a line (not all of ℝ²)}
$$

**The second vector didn't help.** It was "redundant."

**Practice Problem:** What is the span of the following vector in ℝ³?

$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

- (A) A point
- (B) A line through the origin
- (C) A plane through the origin
- (D) All of ℝ³

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(B) A line through the origin**

A single nonzero vector spans a line — all scalar multiples of that vector. To span a plane, you'd need two non-parallel vectors. To span all of ℝ³, you'd need three vectors that don't all lie in a plane.

## Span in ℝ³

In three dimensions:

| Vectors | Typical Span |
|---------|--------------|
| 1 vector | A line through the origin |
| 2 vectors (not parallel) | A plane through the origin |
| 3 vectors (not coplanar) | All of ℝ³ |

**[PLACEHOLDER: Video ~60s]**
_3D visualization: One vector spans a line. Two non-parallel vectors span a plane (show the plane sweeping out). Three non-coplanar vectors span all of 3D space._

Of course, if the vectors are "redundant" (parallel, or all in the same plane), you get less than you might expect.

## The Vector Equation: A New Perspective

Let's look at systems of equations through the lens of linear combinations.

Consider the system:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 &= 4 \\
2x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 &= 7
\end{aligned}
$$

We can rewrite this as a **vector equation**:

$$
x_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + x_3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Now the question becomes: can we find scalars $x_1, x_2, x_3$ that combine these three vectors to reach the target?

This is a **span question**: is $\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}$ in the span of those three vectors?

---

## What Parametric Solutions Tell Us

Suppose we solve this system (using row reduction) and get:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This parametric form is revealing something profound about linear combinations. Let's unpack it.

### The Particular Solution: Reaching the Target

The constant vector $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ gives us coefficients $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = 1$, $x_3 = 0$.

Let's check: this means

$$
2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + 1 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + 0 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 + 2 \\ 4 + 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \checkmark
$$

The particular solution gives coefficients that combine the original vectors to land exactly on the target!

But there are infinitely many solutions. Another is $(3, 0, 1)$:

$$
3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + 0 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + 1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 + 1 \\ 6 + 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \checkmark
$$

### The Direction Vector: Redundancy

Now look at the direction vector $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

This represents coefficients $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = -1$, $x_3 = 1$. What linear combination does this give?

$$
1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + (-1) \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + 1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 - 2 + 1 \\ 2 - 3 + 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

**The direction vector gives a linear combination that sums to zero!**

This is the key insight:

> **Direction vectors in parametric form represent redundancy** — they show how to combine the original vectors to get nothing. Adding any multiple of "nothing" to a valid solution gives another valid solution.

### The Two Pieces Together

| Part of parametric solution | What it represents |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Particular solution** (constant vector) | Coefficients that combine the vectors to reach the target |
| **Direction vectors** (scaled by parameters) | Coefficients that combine the vectors to get **zero** — redundancy in the system |

The direction vectors reveal that one of the original vectors is "unnecessary" — it can be built from the others. In our example, rearranging:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
$$

The third vector is redundant — it's already in the span of the first two.

**Practice Problem:** A system in vector equation form has three vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3$ and a target $\mathbf{b}$. The parametric solution is:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

What does the direction vector $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$ tell you?

- (A) $\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 - \mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{b}$
- (B) $\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 - \mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0}$
- (C) $\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_3$
- (D) Both (B) and (C)

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(D) Both (B) and (C)**

The direction vector gives coefficients for a linear combination that equals zero:

$$1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_1 + 1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2 + (-1) \cdot \mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0}$$

This is statement (B). Rearranging gives $\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_3$, which is statement (C).

Both express the same redundancy: one vector is a linear combination of the others.

</details>

## Summary

- A **linear combination** is a sum of scaled vectors: $c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots$
- The **span** of a set of vectors is all possible linear combinations — everything you can reach
- **Vector equation perspective:** Solving a system means finding coefficients to combine vectors to reach a target
- **Parametric solutions reveal structure:**
  - Particular solution → coefficients that reach the target
  - Direction vectors → coefficients that sum to **zero** (redundancy)
- The direction vectors show that some vectors can be built from others

| In ℝⁿ | Span possibilities |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 vector | Line (1D) |
| 2 non-parallel vectors | Plane (2D) |
| 3 non-coplanar vectors | 3D space |
| $k$ "independent" vectors | $k$-dimensional subspace |

## What's Next?

We've seen that some vectors are "redundant" — they can be written as linear combinations of the others, and the direction vectors in parametric form expose exactly this redundancy.

This leads to a crucial question: given a set of vectors, how do you know if any are redundant?

The answer is **linear independence**, and it's the key to understanding when you have "just enough" vectors versus "too many."
