# Linear Combinations and Span

_What can you build with a set of vectors?_

---

## The Column Picture

Remember back in Unit 1, we solved systems like:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 3y &= 8 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

We called this the **row picture**: each equation is a line, and we find where they intersect.

But there's another way to look at the same system. Let's rewrite it:

$$
x \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Now the question becomes: can we find scalars $x$ and $y$ such that this **linear combination** of column vectors equals the target vector?

This is the **column picture**.

## Linear Combinations

A **linear combination** of vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k$ is any expression of the form:

$$
c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k
$$

where $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ are scalars (real numbers).

You take each vector, scale it by some amount, and add them all together.

### Example

Let $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Some linear combinations:
- $3\mathbf{v}_1 + 2\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$
- $-\mathbf{v}_1 + 4\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$
- $0\mathbf{v}_1 + 0\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$

In fact, with these two vectors, we can reach *any* point in ℝ². To get to $\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$, just use $a\mathbf{v}_1 + b\mathbf{v}_2$.

**Practice Problem:** What is $2\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + (-1)\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$?

- (A) $\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$
- (B) $\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- (C) $\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$
- (D) $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$

**(A) $\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}$**

$$
2\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + (-1)\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}
$$

## Span: All Possible Linear Combinations

Given a set of vectors, the **span** is the set of *all* vectors you can create as linear combinations.

$$
\text{Span}\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\} = \{c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k \mathbf{v}_k : c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

Think of it as: "What can I reach by scaling and adding these vectors?"

### Span of One Vector

Consider a single vector $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Its span is all scalar multiples: $c\mathbf{v}$ for any $c$.

Geometrically, this is a **line through the origin** in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$.

**[PLACEHOLDER: Static image]**
_A line through the origin along direction (2, 1), with several scalar multiples marked._

$$
\text{Span}\bigl\{\mathbf{v}\bigr\} = \text{a line through the origin}
$$

where $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

### Span of Two Vectors in ℝ²

Now take two vectors:
- $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$

These point in *different* directions (neither is a scalar multiple of the other).

Their span is **all of ℝ²** — every point in the plane can be reached!

### When Two Vectors Don't Span ℝ²

What if $\mathbf{v}_2$ is just a scaled version of $\mathbf{v}_1$?

Let $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$.

Notice that $\mathbf{v}_2 = 2\mathbf{v}_1$. Any linear combination is:

$$
c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 (2\mathbf{v}_1) = (c_1 + 2c_2)\mathbf{v}_1
$$

This is still just a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{v}_1$ — we never leave the line!

$$
\text{Span}\bigl\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2\bigr\} = \text{a line (not all of ℝ²)}
$$

where $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$.

**The second vector didn't help.** It was "redundant."

**Practice Problem:** What is the span of the set containing just $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ in ℝ³?

- (A) A point
- (B) A line through the origin
- (C) A plane through the origin
- (D) All of ℝ³

**(B) A line through the origin**

A single nonzero vector spans a line — all scalar multiples of that vector. To span a plane, you'd need two non-parallel vectors. To span all of ℝ³, you'd need three vectors that don't all lie in a plane.

## Span in ℝ³

In three dimensions:

| Vectors | Typical Span |
|---------|--------------|
| 1 vector | A line through the origin |
| 2 vectors (not parallel) | A plane through the origin |
| 3 vectors (not coplanar) | All of ℝ³ |

**[PLACEHOLDER: Video ~60s]**

Of course, if the vectors are "redundant" (parallel, or all in the same plane), you get less than you might expect.

## The Column Picture of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$

Now we can reinterpret our matrix equation. Consider:

$$
A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
$$

where $A$ is a matrix with columns $\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_n$.

The equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is asking:

> **Is $\mathbf{b}$ in the span of the columns of $A$?**

If yes, the system is consistent — $\mathbf{b}$ can be written as a linear combination of the columns. The solution $\mathbf{x}$ gives the coefficients.

If no, the system is inconsistent — $\mathbf{b}$ lies outside the span, and no solution exists.

### Example

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 11 \end{bmatrix}
$$

The column picture asks: can we write $\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 11 \end{bmatrix}$ as a linear combination of $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$?

$$
x_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 11 \end{bmatrix}
$$

These two columns span all of ℝ² (they're not parallel), so yes — we can reach any target, including this one. Solving gives $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 2$.

## When Does $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ Have a Solution (For All $\mathbf{b}$)?

A system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution for every possible $\mathbf{b}$ if and only if:

> **The columns of $A$ span the entire target space.**

For an $m \times n$ matrix $A$:
- The columns live in ℝᵐ
- If they span all of ℝᵐ, every $\mathbf{b}$ in ℝᵐ is reachable
- If they don't span ℝᵐ, some targets are unreachable (inconsistent systems)

---

**Practice Problem:** Let $A$ be the matrix below. This matrix has 3 columns in ℝ².

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Which statement is true about $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$?

- (A) It has a solution for every $\mathbf{b}$ in ℝ²
- (B) It has a solution for some $\mathbf{b}$ in ℝ² but not all
- (C) It never has a solution
- (D) Cannot determine without more information

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(A) It has a solution for every $\mathbf{b}$ in ℝ²**

Three columns in ℝ² — as long as at least two of them span ℝ² (aren't all parallel), every target in ℝ² is reachable. In this case, columns 1 and 2 are $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$, which are not parallel. So the columns span all of ℝ².

(There may be *infinitely many* solutions since we have more columns than necessary, but a solution always exists.)

## Summary

- A **linear combination** is a sum of scaled vectors: $c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots$
- The **span** of a set of vectors is all possible linear combinations — everything you can reach
- **Column picture of $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$:** Is $\mathbf{b}$ in the span of $A$'s columns?
- If columns span the whole target space, the system is always consistent
- Redundant vectors (parallel, coplanar) don't increase the span

| In ℝⁿ | Span possibilities |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 vector | Line (1D) |
| 2 non-parallel vectors | Plane (2D) |
| 3 non-coplanar vectors | 3D space |
| $k$ "independent" vectors | $k$-dimensional subspace |

## What's Next?

We've seen that some vectors are "redundant" — they don't add to the span because they can already be built from others.

This leads to a crucial question: given a set of vectors, how do you know if any are redundant?

The answer is **linear independence**, and it's the key to understanding when you have "just enough" vectors versus "too many."
