# Applications: Why This Matters

_Three real-world problems that are secretly systems of linear equations._

---

You've learned how to solve systems of linear equations. But why should you care?

In this section, we'll see three applications where the machinery of augmented matrices and row reduction does genuinely useful work. These aren't contrived textbook problems — they're simplified versions of things people actually compute.

---

## Application 1: Fitting a Curve Through Points

### The Setup

Imagine you have three data points, and you want to find a parabola that passes through all of them.



Let's say our points are:
- $(1, 2)$
- $(2, 3)$
- $(3, 6)$

We want to find a quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ whose graph passes through all three points.

### Turning It Into a System

What does it mean for the parabola to pass through $(1, 2)$? It means when we plug in $x = 1$, we get $y = 2$:

$$a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 2$$

That simplifies to:
$$a + b + c = 2$$

That's a linear equation in the unknowns $a$, $b$, and $c$!

Let's do the same for all three points:

| Point | Equation |
|-------|----------|
| $(1, 2)$ | $a + b + c = 2$ |
| $(2, 3)$ | $4a + 2b + c = 3$ |
| $(3, 6)$ | $9a + 3b + c = 6$ |

Three equations, three unknowns. We know how to solve this.

### Solving It

**Augmented matrix:**

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
4 & 2 & 1 & 3 \\
9 & 3 & 1 & 6
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
4 & 2 & 1 & 3 \\
9 & 3 & 1 & 6
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow[R_3 - 9R_1]{R_2 - 4R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & -2 & -3 & -5 \\
0 & -6 & -8 & -12
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$
\xrightarrow{R_3 - 3R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & -2 & -3 & -5 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right]
$$

Back-substituting:
- From row 3: $c = 3$
- From row 2: $-2b - 3(3) = -5 \Rightarrow -2b = 4 \Rightarrow b = -2$
- From row 1: $a + (-2) + 3 = 2 \Rightarrow a = 1$

</details>

**Solution:** $a = 1$, $b = -2$, $c = 3$

The parabola is $y = x^2 - 2x + 3$.

### The Big Picture

This technique generalizes beautifully:
- **3 points → unique quadratic** (degree 2 polynomial, 3 coefficients)
- **4 points → unique cubic** (degree 3 polynomial, 4 coefficients)
- **$n$ points → unique degree-$(n-1)$ polynomial**

This is called **polynomial interpolation**, and it's the foundation of curve fitting in data science, computer graphics, and engineering.

---

**Practice Problem:** You want to fit a quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ through the points $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(2, 3)$.

What equation does the point $(0, 1)$ give you?

- (A) $a + b + c = 1$
- (B) $c = 1$
- (C) $a = 1$
- (D) $b = 1$

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(B) $c = 1$**

Plugging in $x = 0$, $y = 1$:
$$a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 1$$
$$c = 1$$

The point $(0, 1)$ directly tells us the constant term!

</details>

## Application 2: Balancing Chemical Equations

### The Setup

In chemistry, you can't create or destroy atoms — you can only rearrange them. This means chemical equations must be **balanced**: the same number of each type of atom on both sides.

Consider the combustion of propane:

$$\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

We need to find coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ such that:

$$a\,\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + b\,\text{O}_2 \rightarrow c\,\text{CO}_2 + d\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

has the same number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms on each side.

### Turning It Into a System

Let's count atoms:

**Carbon (C):**
- Left side: $3a$ (each propane has 3 carbons)
- Right side: $c$ (each CO₂ has 1 carbon)
- Equation: $3a = c$, or $3a - c = 0$

**Hydrogen (H):**
- Left side: $8a$ (each propane has 8 hydrogens)
- Right side: $2d$ (each H₂O has 2 hydrogens)
- Equation: $8a = 2d$, or $8a - 2d = 0$

**Oxygen (O):**
- Left side: $2b$ (each O₂ has 2 oxygens)
- Right side: $2c + d$ (CO₂ contributes 2, H₂O contributes 1)
- Equation: $2b = 2c + d$, or $2b - 2c - d = 0$

### The System

$$
\begin{aligned}
3a - c &= 0 \\
8a - 2d &= 0 \\
2b - 2c - d &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a **homogeneous** system (all zeros on the right). It definitely has the trivial solution $a = b = c = d = 0$, but that's not useful — it means "no reaction."

We want nontrivial solutions!

### Solving It

**Augmented matrix:**

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
3 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
8 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -2 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

With 4 unknowns and 3 equations, we expect at least one free variable.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the row reduction</strong></summary>

Let's rearrange columns for clarity (ordering as $a, b, c, d$):

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
3 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
8 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -2 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Scale row 1:
$$
\xrightarrow{\frac{1}{3}R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 0 & -\frac{1}{3} & 0 & 0 \\
8 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -2 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Eliminate in column 1:
$$
\xrightarrow{R_2 - 8R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 0 & -\frac{1}{3} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{8}{3} & -2 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -2 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Swap rows 2 and 3:
$$
\xrightarrow{R_2 \leftrightarrow R_3}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 0 & -\frac{1}{3} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -2 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{8}{3} & -2 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Scale rows:
$$
\xrightarrow[\frac{3}{8}R_3]{\frac{1}{2}R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 0 & -\frac{1}{3} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -\frac{3}{4} & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

The variable $d$ is free. Let $d = 4$ (chosen to avoid fractions):

From row 3: $c = \frac{3}{4}(4) = 3$
From row 2: $b = c + \frac{1}{2}d = 3 + 2 = 5$
From row 1: $a = \frac{1}{3}c = 1$

</details>

**Solution:** $a = 1$, $b = 5$, $c = 3$, $d = 4$

The balanced equation is:

$$\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5\,\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\,\text{CO}_2 + 4\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Let's verify:
- Carbon: $3 = 3$ ✓
- Hydrogen: $8 = 8$ ✓
- Oxygen: $10 = 6 + 4 = 10$ ✓

### Why Homogeneous?

Notice that the system was homogeneous — all zeros on the right. This makes physical sense: atom conservation is about *ratios*, not absolute amounts. If $(1, 5, 3, 4)$ works, so does $(2, 10, 6, 8)$. We just pick the smallest whole-number solution.

---

**Practice Problem:** When balancing a chemical equation with 5 different substances and 3 types of atoms, how many free variables do you expect?

- (A) 0
- (B) 1
- (C) 2
- (D) 3

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(C) 2**

You have 5 unknowns (one coefficient per substance) and 3 equations (one per atom type). Assuming the equations are independent:

Free variables = 5 - 3 = 2

This means there's a 2-dimensional family of solutions. You'd typically pick one by setting a coefficient to 1 and finding the smallest integers.

## Application 3: Traffic Flow

### The Setup

Imagine a network of one-way streets in a city. Cars flow into the network, through the intersections, and out of the network. At each intersection, the flow in must equal the flow out (cars don't just disappear).

<iframe src="https://ilundholm.github.io/linear_algebra_KA/widgets/network-flow.html" width="100%" height="550" style="border: none; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
_Verify flow conservation: inputs must equal outputs at every node._

Consider this network:

```
        300 →
    ┌─────────────┐
    │      A      │
200 ↓             ↓ x₁
    │             │
    B ─────────→ C
    │     x₂     │
150 ↓             ↓ x₃
    │             │
    └─────────────┘
        250 ←
```

External flows (known):
- 200 cars/hour enter at B
- 150 cars/hour enter at the bottom of B
- 300 cars/hour enter at A
- 250 cars/hour exit at the bottom of C
- Cars also exit through $x_1$ and $x_3$

Internal flows (unknown):
- $x_1$: flow from A to C
- $x_2$: flow from B to C  
- $x_3$: flow out of C at bottom

### Turning It Into a System

At each intersection, flow in = flow out.

**Intersection A:**
$$300 = x_1 + (\text{flow continuing around})$$

Let's simplify to a more concrete example:

**[PLACEHOLDER: Better diagram with cleaner flow]**

Consider a simpler network:

```
     400
      ↓
   ┌──A──┐
   ↓     ↓
  x₁    x₂
   ↓     ↓
   B──→──C → 600
   ↑  x₃  
  500
```

- 400 cars/hour enter at A, split into $x_1$ (to B) and $x_2$ (to C)
- 500 cars/hour enter at B
- All traffic exits at C (600 cars/hour)

**Node A (conservation):**
$$400 = x_1 + x_2$$

**Node B (conservation):**
$$x_1 + 500 = x_3$$

**Node C (conservation):**
$$x_2 + x_3 = 600$$

### Solving It

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 + x_2 &= 400 \\
x_1 - x_3 &= -500 \\
x_2 + x_3 &= 600
\end{aligned}
$$

**Augmented matrix:**

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
1 & 0 & -1 & -500 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 600
\end{array}\right]
$$

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the row reduction</strong></summary>

$$
\xrightarrow{R_2 - R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & -900 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 600
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$
\xrightarrow{R_3 + R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & -900 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -300
\end{array}\right]
$$

Uh oh! The last row says $0 = -300$. That's inconsistent!

</details>

**Wait — no solution?**

This means our flow values are inconsistent. Let's check: 400 + 500 = 900 cars enter, but only 600 exit. That's impossible in a steady state!

Let's fix the exit to 900:

$$x_2 + x_3 = 900$$

Now:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the corrected row reduction</strong></summary>

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
1 & 0 & -1 & -500 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 900
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$
\xrightarrow{R_2 - R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & -900 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 900
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$
\xrightarrow{R_3 + R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & -900 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

A zero row! This means we have a free variable.

$$
\xrightarrow{-R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 400 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 900 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Let $x_3 = t$ (free variable). Then:
- $x_2 = 900 - t$
- $x_1 = 400 - x_2 = 400 - (900 - t) = t - 500$

But wait — traffic flow can't be negative! We need $x_1 \geq 0$, so $t \geq 500$.
And $x_2 \geq 0$, so $t \leq 900$.

</details>

**Solution:** The flows are:
- $x_1 = t - 500$
- $x_2 = 900 - t$  
- $x_3 = t$

where $500 \leq t \leq 900$.

This means there are *many* possible steady-state flows! The road from B to C ($x_3$) could carry anywhere from 500 to 900 cars/hour, with the other flows adjusting accordingly.

### Why This Matters

Traffic engineers use exactly this kind of analysis to:
- Detect inconsistent sensor data (no solution = something's wrong)
- Understand flexibility in the network (free variables = choices)
- Plan for construction (what if we close a road?)

The constraint that flows must be non-negative adds an extra wrinkle — this is where linear algebra meets **linear programming**, a topic for another course.

---

**Practice Problem:** A network has 4 internal road segments and 3 intersections. If all intersection equations are independent, how many free variables are there?

- (A) 0
- (B) 1
- (C) 2
- (D) Cannot determine

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(B) 1**

4 unknowns (road segments) and 3 equations (intersections, assuming independent):

Free variables = 4 - 3 = 1

This represents one degree of freedom in how traffic can distribute through the network.

</details>

---

## Summary

Systems of linear equations aren't just abstract math — they're the hidden structure behind many real problems:

| Application | Unknowns | Equations | Key Insight |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Curve fitting | Polynomial coefficients | Points the curve passes through | $n$ points determine degree-$(n-1)$ polynomial |
| Balancing chemical equations | Molecular coefficients | Atom conservation | Homogeneous system; want nontrivial solution |
| Traffic flow | Road segment flows | Intersection conservation | May have free variables (flexibility) |

What these have in common:
- **Conservation laws** (atoms, cars) become equations
- **Unknown quantities** become variables
- **Row reduction** does the heavy lifting

And now you have the tools to solve them.

---

## What's Next?

We've conquered systems of linear equations from the **row picture** — each equation as a geometric constraint, each row as a line or plane.

But there's a completely different way to look at $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. Instead of asking "where do these planes intersect?", we can ask "can we build $\mathbf{b}$ out of the columns of $A$?"

That's the **column picture**, and it's coming up in Unit 2.
