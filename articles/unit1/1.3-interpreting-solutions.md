# Interpreting Solutions

_How to read the answer from a reduced matrix — and what to do when there isn't just one._

---

## Reading RREF: The Easy Case

When row reduction gives you something like this:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 5
\end{array}\right]
$$

Life is simple. The left side is the identity matrix, and you can read off the solution directly:

$$x = 2, \quad y = -1, \quad z = 5$$

**One equation, one unknown, one answer per variable.** This is the unique solution case.

But what about when the RREF looks... weirder?

---

## Pivots and Free Variables

Not every column gets a pivot. Look at this RREF:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
\boxed{1} & 2 & 0 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & \boxed{1} & -1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

The pivots (boxed) are in columns 1 and 3. But columns 2 and 4 don't have pivots.

Here's the key terminology:

- **Pivot columns** (columns 1 and 3): the corresponding variables are called **basic variables** or **pivot variables**
- **Non-pivot columns** (columns 2 and 4): the corresponding variables are called **free variables**

If we call our variables $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$:
- $x_1$ and $x_3$ are basic (determined by the pivots)
- $x_2$ and $x_4$ are free (we can choose them!)

---

## Free Variables = Freedom

When you have free variables, you can set them to *any value you want*, and then solve for the basic variables. This is why there are infinitely many solutions.

Let's work through it. Our RREF corresponds to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_4 &= 4 \\
x_3 - x_4 &= 2
\end{aligned}
$$

**Step 1: Move free variables to the right side**

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 &= 4 - 2x_2 - 3x_4 \\
x_3 &= 2 + x_4
\end{aligned}
$$

**Step 2: Let the free variables be parameters**

Set $x_2 = s$ and $x_4 = t$, where $s$ and $t$ can be any real numbers:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_1 &= 4 - 2s - 3t \\
x_2 &= s \\
x_3 &= 2 + t \\
x_4 &= t
\end{aligned}
$$

This describes *all* solutions. Every choice of $(s, t)$ gives a different valid solution.

**Practice Problem:** Using the formulas above, what solution do you get when $s = 1$ and $t = 0$?

- (A) $(1, 1, 2, 0)$
- (B) $(2, 1, 2, 0)$
- (C) $(2, 1, 3, 0)$
- (D) $(4, 0, 2, 0)$

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(B) $(2, 1, 2, 0)$**

Substituting $s = 1$, $t = 0$:
- $x_1 = 4 - 2(1) - 3(0) = 2$
- $x_2 = 1$
- $x_3 = 2 + 0 = 2$
- $x_4 = 0$

You can verify: $2 + 2(1) + 0 + 3(0) = 4$ ✓ and $2 - 0 = 2$ ✓

## Parametric Vector Form

There's an elegant way to write infinitely many solutions using vectors. Let's rewrite our solution:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} 4 - 2s - 3t \\ s \\ 2 + t \\ t \end{bmatrix}
$$

Now, separate this into pieces — the part that doesn't depend on parameters, and the parts that do:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
+ s \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
+ t \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This is **parametric vector form**. It says:

> Start at the particular solution $(4, 0, 2, 0)$, then move any amount in the direction $(-2, 1, 0, 0)$ and any amount in the direction $(-3, 0, 1, 1)$.

Geometrically, the solution set is a *plane* through $(4, 0, 2, 0)$ in 4-dimensional space!

_3D analogy: show a plane in 3D as a point plus two direction vectors. "In higher dimensions, the same idea works."_

## The General Pattern

Every system of linear equations has a solution set that looks like this:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p} + s_1\mathbf{v}_1 + s_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + s_k\mathbf{v}_k
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{p}$ is a **particular solution** (one specific solution to the system)
- Each $\mathbf{v}_i$ is a **direction you can move** without leaving the solution set
- $k$ = number of free variables

| Free variables | Solution set |
|----------------|--------------|
| 0 | A single point (unique solution) |
| 1 | A line |
| 2 | A plane |
| 3 | A 3D "hyperplane" |
| $k$ | A $k$-dimensional flat |

## Homogeneous Systems: A Special Case

A system is **homogeneous** if all the constants on the right side are zero:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + y - z &= 0 \\
x - y + 2z &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The augmented matrix looks like:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
2 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 2 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Key fact:** Homogeneous systems *always* have at least one solution — the **trivial solution**:

$$x = 0, \quad y = 0, \quad z = 0$$

(Check: $2(0) + 0 - 0 = 0$ ✓ and $0 - 0 + 2(0) = 0$ ✓)

The interesting question for homogeneous systems is: are there *nontrivial* solutions?

**Practice Problem:** A homogeneous system has 3 equations and 5 unknowns. What can you say about its solutions?

- (A) It has only the trivial solution
- (B) It definitely has nontrivial solutions
- (C) It might or might not have nontrivial solutions
- (D) It has no solutions

<details>

**(B) It definitely has nontrivial solutions.**

With 5 unknowns and only 3 equations, we can have at most 3 pivots. That means at least $5 - 3 = 2$ free variables.

Free variables → infinitely many solutions → definitely more than just the trivial solution!

This is a general principle: if a homogeneous system has more unknowns than equations, it *must* have nontrivial solutions.

## Homogeneous vs. Non-Homogeneous

There's a beautiful relationship between these two types of systems.

Consider a non-homogeneous system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.

The corresponding **associated homogeneous system** is $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ (same coefficients, but zeros on the right).

**The connection:**

> If $\mathbf{p}$ is a particular solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{v}$ is *any* solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$, then $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{v}$ is also a solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.

This explains parametric vector form! The vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots$ are solutions to the homogeneous system. They describe the "shape" of the solution set. The particular solution $\mathbf{p}$ shifts that shape to pass through the right point.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does this work?</strong></summary>

If $A\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}$ and $A\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$, then:

$$A(\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{v}) = A\mathbf{p} + A\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{b}$$

So $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{v}$ is indeed a solution to the original system.

## When Does a Solution Exist?

So far, we've seen systems with one solution or infinitely many. But sometimes there's **no solution at all**.

Look at this RREF:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 0 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 5
\end{array}\right]
$$

That last row says: $0x + 0y + 0z = 5$, which simplifies to $0 = 5$.

That's never true! The system is **inconsistent** — no solution exists.

**The telltale sign:** A row of the form $[0 \; 0 \; \cdots \; 0 \; | \; c]$ where $c \neq 0$.

This means there's a pivot in the augmented column (the last column). That's bad — it corresponds to an equation that can't be satisfied.

---

## The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem

Putting it all together:

**A system of linear equations has:**

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Pivot in last column | **No solution** (inconsistent) |
| No pivot in last column, no free variables | **Exactly one solution** |
| No pivot in last column, at least one free variable | **Infinitely many solutions** |

Or in plain English:
- If the equations contradict each other → no solution
- If every variable is pinned down → one solution  
- If some variables are free → infinitely many solutions

_Decision tree: Start with RREF → Check for pivot in augmented column → If yes: no solution. If no: count free variables → If 0: unique. If ≥1: infinite._

**Practice Problem:** A system's RREF is:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
1 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Which statement is true?

- (A) No solution exists
- (B) There is exactly one solution
- (C) There are infinitely many solutions, with 1 free variable
- (D) There are infinitely many solutions, with 2 free variables

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(C) There are infinitely many solutions, with 1 free variable.**

- No pivot in the augmented column (last column), so solutions exist
- Pivots in columns 1, 3, and 4
- Column 2 has no pivot → $x_2$ is a free variable
- Only 1 free variable

The solution set is a line (1-dimensional) in 4-dimensional space.

</details>

## Summary

- **Pivot variables** (basic variables): determined by the equations
- **Free variables**: can be set to any value, creating infinitely many solutions
- **Parametric vector form:** $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p} + s_1\mathbf{v}_1 + s_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots$
- **Homogeneous systems** ($\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0}$): always have the trivial solution; may have infinitely many
- **Existence:** pivot in augmented column → no solution
- **Uniqueness:** no free variables → exactly one solution

The number of free variables tells you the *dimension* of the solution set:
- 0 free variables → point
- 1 free variable → line
- 2 free variables → plane
- etc.

## What's Next?

We've now fully conquered the mechanics of solving $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. You can take any system, row-reduce it, and read off whether there are zero, one, or infinitely many solutions — and describe them precisely.

But you might be wondering: *why should I care?*

In the next section, we'll see systems of linear equations in action. We'll fit curves through data points, balance chemical equations, and analyze traffic flow through networks. These aren't contrived examples — they're real problems where row reduction does genuinely useful work.

After that, we'll shift to an entirely new perspective in Unit 2. Instead of seeing $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ as a system of equations (the **row picture**), we'll see it as a question about **vectors**: "Can we combine the columns of $A$ to reach $\mathbf{b}$?" This **column picture** opens up a whole new way of understanding linear algebra.
