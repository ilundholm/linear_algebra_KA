# Introduction to Linear Systems

_What is a system of linear equations, and what does it mean to solve one?_

---

## A Single Linear Equation

Before we talk about *systems* of equations, let's make sure we're on the same page about what makes an equation "linear."

A **linear equation** is one where each variable shows up only to the first power — no squares, no square roots, no variables multiplied together. Just variables, coefficients, and addition.

Here are some examples of linear equations:

- $2x + 3y = 7$
- $x - 4y + z = 0$
- $x = 5$

And here are some equations that are **not** linear:

- $x^2 + y = 1$ (that $x^2$ disqualifies it)
- $xy = 6$ (variables multiplied together)
- $\sin(x) + y = 0$ (that sine function is a problem)

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do we care about this restriction?</strong></summary>

Linear equations are special because they have a beautiful geometric interpretation: every linear equation in two variables describes a **line**, and every linear equation in three variables describes a **plane**. This geometric connection is what makes linear algebra so visual and intuitive.

Nonlinear equations can describe curves, surfaces, and all sorts of complicated shapes. That's fine, but the tools we'll develop in this course are specifically designed for the straight-line world.

## What Is a System?

A **system of linear equations** is just a collection of linear equations that we want to solve *simultaneously*. We're looking for values that make *all* of the equations true at once.

Here's a system of two equations in two unknowns:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

A **solution** to this system is a pair of values $(x, y)$ that satisfies both equations. 

Let's check: does $(3, 2)$ work?

- First equation: $3 + 2 = 5$ ✓
- Second equation: $3 - 2 = 1$ ✓

Yes! So $(3, 2)$ is a solution.

**Practice Problem:** Does the point $(4, 1)$ solve the system above?

- (A) Yes, it satisfies both equations
- (B) No, it fails the first equation
- (C) No, it fails the second equation
- (D) No, it fails both equations

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(C) No, it fails the second equation.**

Let's check:
- First equation: $4 + 1 = 5$ ✓
- Second equation: $4 - 1 = 3 \neq 1$ ✗

The point $(4, 1)$ lies on the first line, but not the second.

## The Row Picture: Equations as Geometry

Here's where things get visual. Each linear equation in two variables represents a **line** in the plane. When we solve a system of two equations, we're asking: *where do these lines intersect?*

Let's look at our system geometrically:

- $x + y = 5$ is a line (all points where the coordinates sum to 5)
- $x - y = 1$ is another line (all points where the coordinates differ by 1)

**[PLACEHOLDER: Video ~30s]**

The solution $(3, 2)$ is exactly the point where the two lines cross.

This is called the **row picture** — we're viewing each equation (each "row" of the system) as a geometric object, and looking for where they meet.

## Three Things That Can Happen

When you have two lines in a plane, there are exactly three possibilities:

### 1. The lines intersect at exactly one point

This is the most common case. The lines cross, and there's a unique solution.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

**One solution:** $(3, 2)$

---

### 2. The lines are parallel (no intersection)

If the lines have the same slope but different intercepts, they never meet. The system has **no solution**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
x + y &= 7
\end{aligned}
$$

Think about it: we're asking for a point where $x + y$ equals both 5 and 7 at the same time. That's impossible!

_Two parallel lines, clearly not intersecting._

**No solution.** We call this system **inconsistent**.

---

### 3. The lines are the same line (infinite intersection)

If both equations describe the exact same line, then *every* point on that line is a solution.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
2x + 2y &= 10
\end{aligned}
$$

The second equation is just the first one multiplied by 2 — they're the same geometric object!

![One line representing both equations](/linear_algebra_KA/images/two_lines_same.png)
_One line, with text indicating it represents both equations._

**Infinitely many solutions.** Every point $(x, y)$ with $x + y = 5$ works.

---

**Practice Problem:** Consider the system:
$$
\begin{aligned}
2x - y &= 4 \\
4x - 2y &= 8
\end{aligned}
$$

How many solutions does this system have?

- (A) No solution
- (B) Exactly one solution
- (C) Infinitely many solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(C) Infinitely many solutions.**

The second equation is exactly 2 times the first equation. They represent the same line, so every point on that line is a solution.

For example: $(2, 0)$, $(3, 2)$, $(0, -4)$ all work. Try them!

## Moving to Three Dimensions

In three variables, each linear equation represents a **plane** instead of a line.

$$
x + y + z = 6
$$

This is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ in 3D space whose coordinates sum to 6. It's a flat surface — a plane.

**[PLACEHOLDER: Video ~45s]**
_3D animation showing a plane in space, then a second plane appearing. Show how two planes typically intersect in a line. Then add a third plane and show the three meeting at a point._

When we have three equations in three unknowns:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y + z &= 6 \\
x - y + z &= 2 \\
x + y - z &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

We're looking for where three planes intersect. 

- Two planes typically intersect in a **line**
- Three planes typically intersect in a **point**

The same three possibilities exist:

| Situation | Geometry | Solutions |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Planes meet at a point | Common intersection | **One solution** |
| Planes form a "prism" (no common point) | Parallel or triangular arrangement | **No solution** |
| Planes share a line or are all the same | Overlapping | **Infinitely many** |

## Why "Linear" Matters

Notice that the geometry is remarkably simple:
- Lines intersect in points (or not at all, or everywhere)
- Planes intersect in lines or points (or not at all, or everywhere)

There's no complicated curving, no multiple intersection points, no tangencies. This simplicity is *because* we restricted ourselves to linear equations.

The entire subject of linear algebra is built on exploiting this simplicity. We'll develop powerful tools that work precisely because we're in this well-behaved linear world.

## What's Next?

We've seen that solving a system of linear equations means finding where geometric objects intersect. But staring at graphs only gets us so far — especially when we have 4, 5, or 100 variables (try visualizing that!).

In the next section, we'll introduce **augmented matrices** and **row reduction** — a systematic, algorithmic way to solve any system of linear equations, no matter how large.

## Summary

- A **linear equation** has variables only to the first power, with no products of variables
- A **system** is a collection of equations we solve simultaneously
- **The Row Picture:** each equation is a geometric object (line, plane, hyperplane)
- **Solutions** are where these objects intersect
- Three possibilities: **one solution**, **no solution**, or **infinitely many solutions**
- This geometric simplicity is what makes linear systems tractable

**Practice Problem:** A system of 4 linear equations in 4 unknowns represents the intersection of four _____  in 4-dimensional space.

- (A) Lines
- (B) Planes
- (C) Hyperplanes
- (D) Points

**(C) Hyperplanes.**

In $n$-dimensional space, a single linear equation describes an $(n-1)$-dimensional flat object called a **hyperplane**. 

- In 2D: a hyperplane is a line (1D)
- In 3D: a hyperplane is a plane (2D)  
- In 4D: a hyperplane is a 3D "flat" object

We can't visualize 4D, but the algebra works the same way!
