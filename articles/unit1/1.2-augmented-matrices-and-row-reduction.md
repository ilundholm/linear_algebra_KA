# Augmented Matrices and Row Reduction

_A systematic method for solving any system of linear equations._

---

## The Problem with "Just Looking"

In the previous section, we solved a simple system by inspection:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

We could practically *see* that $x = 3$ and $y = 2$ worked. But what about this system?

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x - y + 3z &= 9 \\
x + 2y - z &= -2 \\
3x - y + 2z &= 7
\end{aligned}
$$

Or a system with 10 equations and 10 unknowns? We need a *method* — an algorithm that works every time, no matter how complicated the system.

That method is called **Gaussian elimination**, and the key tool is the **augmented matrix**.

---

## From Equations to Matrices

Look at a system of equations. What information does it actually contain?

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 3y &= 8 \\
x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Really, it's just a grid of numbers: the coefficients on the left, and the constants on the right. The variables ($x$, $y$) and the symbols ($+$, $=$) are the same every time.

Let's strip away the redundancy and write just the numbers:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
2 & 3 & 8 \\
1 & -1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

This is the **augmented matrix** of the system. The vertical bar separates the coefficients (on the left) from the constants (on the right).

**Practice Problem:** Write the augmented matrix for this system:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x - 2y + z &= 0 \\
3y - z &= 4 \\
-x + y + 2z &= -3
\end{aligned}
$$

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 3 & -1 & 4 \\
-1 & 1 & 2 & -3
\end{array}\right]
$$

Notice the 0 in the second row, first column — there's no $x$ term in that equation!

## The Rules of the Game: Elementary Row Operations

Here's the key insight: certain operations on the rows of a matrix *don't change the solutions* to the system. These are called **elementary row operations**, and there are exactly three types:

### 1. Swap two rows

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 5 \\
3 & 4 & 6
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow{R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
3 & 4 & 6 \\
1 & 2 & 5
\end{array}\right]
$$

This just reorders the equations. The solutions don't change.

### 2. Multiply a row by a nonzero constant

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
2 & 4 & 6 \\
1 & 3 & 5
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow{\frac{1}{2}R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 3 & 5
\end{array}\right]
$$

Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same nonzero number gives an equivalent equation.

### 3. Add a multiple of one row to another row

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 3 & 5
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow{R_2 - R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right]
$$

This is the workhorse operation. We subtracted Row 1 from Row 2 to create a zero in the bottom-left position.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does this preserve solutions?</strong></summary>

If equation 1 says $A = B$ and equation 2 says $C = D$, then the equation $C - A = D - B$ is also true. We're not adding new information or losing old information — just recombining what we already know.

</details>

## The Goal: Row Echelon Form

Using these operations, we're going to transform the matrix into a special shape called **row echelon form (REF)**. Here's what it looks like:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
\boxed{1} & * & * & * \\
0 & \boxed{1} & * & * \\
0 & 0 & \boxed{1} & *
\end{array}\right]
$$

The key features:
- Each row starts with more zeros than the row above it (staircase pattern)
- The first nonzero entry in each row is called a **pivot**
- Pivots are typically scaled to be 1

## Let's Do One Together

Solve this system using row reduction:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + 2y &= 5 \\
3x + 5y &= 14
\end{aligned}
$$

**Step 1: Write the augmented matrix**

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 14
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Step 2: Create a zero below the first pivot**

We want to eliminate the 3 in row 2. Subtract 3 times row 1 from row 2:

$$
R_2 - 3R_1: \quad (3, 5, 14) - 3(1, 2, 5) = (0, -1, -1)
$$

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 5 \\
0 & -1 & -1
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Step 3: Scale row 2 to make the pivot 1**

Multiply row 2 by $-1$:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 5 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

This is now in row echelon form! The staircase is clear.

**Step 4: Back-substitute**

From row 2: $y = 1$

Substitute into row 1: $x + 2(1) = 5$, so $x = 3$

**Solution:** $(x, y) = (3, 1)$

---

**Practice Problem:** Use row reduction to solve:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + y &= 7 \\
x - y &= 2
\end{aligned}
$$

What is $x$?

- (A) $x = 1$
- (B) $x = 2$
- (C) $x = 3$
- (D) $x = 4$

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(C) $x = 3$**

Here's the work:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
2 & 1 & 7 \\
1 & -1 & 2
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow{R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & -1 & 2 \\
2 & 1 & 7
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$
\xrightarrow{R_2 - 2R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & -1 & 2 \\
0 & 3 & 3
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow{\frac{1}{3}R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & -1 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

From row 2: $y = 1$. From row 1: $x - 1 = 2$, so $x = 3$.

</details>

---

## Going Further: Reduced Row Echelon Form

We can keep going and eliminate the entries *above* the pivots too. This gives us **reduced row echelon form (RREF)**:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & -1 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\xrightarrow{R_1 + R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 0 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

Now we can read off the solution directly: $x = 3$, $y = 1$. No back-substitution needed!

**RREF has these properties:**
1. It's in row echelon form (staircase of zeros)
2. Each pivot is 1
3. Each pivot is the *only* nonzero entry in its column

## A Larger Example

Let's tackle a 3×3 system:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y + z &= 6 \\
2x + y - z &= 1 \\
x - y + 2z &= 5
\end{aligned}
$$

**Augmented matrix:**
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
2 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 2 & 5
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Create zeros in column 1:**
$$
\xrightarrow[R_3 - R_1]{R_2 - 2R_1}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
0 & -1 & -3 & -11 \\
0 & -2 & 1 & -1
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Scale row 2:**
$$
\xrightarrow{-R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
0 & 1 & 3 & 11 \\
0 & -2 & 1 & -1
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Create zero in column 2, row 3:**
$$
\xrightarrow{R_3 + 2R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
0 & 1 & 3 & 11 \\
0 & 0 & 7 & 21
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Scale row 3:**
$$
\xrightarrow{\frac{1}{7}R_3}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
0 & 1 & 3 & 11 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right]
$$

This is **REF**! Now continue to **RREF**:

**Eliminate above the third pivot:**
$$
\xrightarrow[R_1 - R_3]{R_2 - 3R_3}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Eliminate above the second pivot:**
$$
\xrightarrow{R_1 - R_2}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Solution:** $x = 1$, $y = 2$, $z = 3$

## The Algorithm: Gaussian Elimination

Here's the procedure, summarized:

### Forward Phase (get to REF)
1. Find the leftmost nonzero column (this will contain a pivot)
2. If necessary, swap rows to get a nonzero entry at the top
3. Scale to make that pivot equal to 1
4. Use row operations to create zeros below the pivot
5. Cover the top row and repeat on the remaining submatrix

### Backward Phase (get to RREF)
6. Starting from the bottom pivot, use row operations to create zeros *above* each pivot

## Why This Matters

Row reduction isn't just a technique for solving specific systems — it's *the* fundamental algorithm of linear algebra. Nearly everything we'll do later connects back to this process:

- Finding whether solutions exist
- Describing all solutions when there are infinitely many
- Computing matrix inverses
- Finding bases for subspaces
- Determining rank

The augmented matrix and row operations are your bread and butter. Get comfortable with them.

---

## Summary

- An **augmented matrix** captures all the information in a system of equations
- **Elementary row operations** (swap, scale, add multiple) don't change solutions
- **Row echelon form (REF):** staircase of zeros, each row starts further right
- **Reduced row echelon form (RREF):** pivots are 1, and they're the only nonzero entry in their column
- **Gaussian elimination:** the algorithm that transforms any matrix into RREF
- Every matrix has a unique RREF (though the steps to get there may vary)

---

**Practice Problem:** After row reduction, you get:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 0 & 2 & 5 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

What does the third row tell you?

- (A) $z = 0$
- (B) The system has no solution
- (C) The system has infinitely many solutions
- (D) Nothing — it's a redundant equation

<details>
<summary><strong>Check your answer</strong></summary>

**(D) Nothing — it's a redundant equation.**

The third row says $0x + 0y + 0z = 0$, which is $0 = 0$. This is always true but gives us no information.

(Note: This matrix *does* lead to infinitely many solutions, but that's because of the structure of columns 1 and 2, not directly because of the zero row. We'll explore this more in the next section!)
