## Phase 1: Content Complete (Units 1-3) ✅

- [x] Unit 1 articles (4 articles)
- [x] Unit 2 articles (3 articles)
- [x] Unit 3 articles (3 articles)
- [x] Exercise templates for Units 1-3

**Total: 10 articles, 33 exercise types templated**

---

## Phase 2: Make It Viewable (Next)

- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages with MathJax
- [ ] Basic navigation/index page
- [ ] Static diagrams for key concepts
- [ ] Update article cross-references

---

## Phase 3: Make It Interactive

- [ ] Research Perseus exercise format (KA's system)
- [ ] Build or adapt exercise grading system
- [ ] Create interactive widgets for:
  - Vector addition visualizer
  - Span explorer
  - Transformation grid viewer
  - Row reduction step-by-step tool

---

## Phase 4: Video Production

- [ ] Test Manim installation
- [ ] Create short clips (~30-60s) for article placeholders
- [ ] Longer videos if needed

## Decisions Made

1. **Exercise platform:** Aim for Perseus-compatible JSON (full KA format)
2. **Video scope:** Supplementary video moments for articles (tractable)
3. **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
4. **Demo artifact:** URL to GitHub Pages

---

## Open Questions

1. **GitHub Pages setup:** Jekyll theme? Custom HTML? MathJax version?
2. **Perseus research:** How much of the format is documented publicly?
3. **Manim:** Is it installed? Can we render?
