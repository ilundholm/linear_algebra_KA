# Linear Algebra: A Modern Perspective

A comprehensive, intuition-first curriculum for Linear Algebra.

---

## About This Project

This is an expansion of Khan Academy's Linear Algebra course, emphasizing:

- **Intuition before formalism** — visualize first, symbolize second
- **Three perspectives** on every concept: row picture, column picture, transformation picture
- **Interleaved practice** — exercises embedded throughout, not just at the end
- **Real applications** — curve fitting, chemistry, traffic flow, and more

## The Three Perspectives

Our approach emphasizes three complementary views of the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$:

1. **The Row Picture:** Each equation is a geometric constraint (line, plane, hyperplane). Solutions are intersections.

2. **The Column Picture:** $A\mathbf{x}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$. "Can we reach $\mathbf{b}$?"

3. **The Transformation Picture:** $A$ is a function that warps space. "What input $\mathbf{x}$ maps to output $\mathbf{b}$?"
