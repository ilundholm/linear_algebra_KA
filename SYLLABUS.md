# Syllabus: Linear Algebra Expansion

## Unit 1: Foundations of $Ax = b$

### 1.1 The System of Equations View (The Row Picture)
- **Concept:** Every equation is a geometric constraint (line, plane, hyperplane).
- **Visualization:** Intersecting lines in 2D and planes in 3D.
- **Key Idea:** Solutions are points where all constraints are satisfied.
- **Exercises:**
    - Identifying intersection types (one, none, infinite).
    - Converting between algebraic equations and geometric descriptions.

### 1.2 The Vector Equation View (The Column Picture)
- **Concept:** $Ax$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
- **Visualization:** Vectors scaling and adding "tip-to-tail" to reach a target $b$.
- **Key Idea:** Span and the question "Can we reach $b$?"
- **Exercises:**
    - Visualizing vector sums.
    - Solving for weights (scalars) in a linear combination.

### 1.3 The Matrix Equation View (The Transformation Picture)
- **Concept:** $A$ is a function that maps an input vector $x$ to an output vector $b$.
- **Visualization:** The unit grid warping under the transformation.
- **Key Idea:** Determinants (area/volume scaling) and the "feel" of a transformation.
- **Exercises:**
    - Predicting the output of a transformation.
    - Identifying standard transformations (rotations, shears, reflections).
